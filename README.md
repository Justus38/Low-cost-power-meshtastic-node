this is a low cost/power meshtastic node designed by myself. credits go to faketec by gargomoma which inspired me to do this project. 
## Hardware
the node uses the nrf52840 on the nice!nano development board. Its radio is the seeed studio wio sx1262. it supports battery operation via the two battery pins
### Software
the meshtastic node uses the firmware of the diy nrf52. you can find it if you go to the flashing website and then scroll all the way down to the community firmwares
